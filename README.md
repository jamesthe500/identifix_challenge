This is my solution for the take-home Identifix code challenge.<br>
After downloading the zip, don't forget to run an "npm install" to get bootstrap and jquery in their right places.<br>

One challenge was figuring out how to best calculate horsepower, since it wasn't one of the parameters given by CarQuery. In my search through Wikipedia and other such sites, I found algebra to convert Newton-meters to HP, but RPMs were needed and they weren't necessarily defined. I eventually landed on a <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/columns/larry-webster-horsepower-confusion-and-resolution-column">Car and Driver</a> article which went in a different direction, but did teach me about the unit, Pferdest√§rke (PS) which is provided by CarQuery. One PS is equal to 0.9863 HP. I applied this to the Chevrolet Corvette from the example, which has a rating of 650HP, and came up with 641hp, quite different from the example of 449hp. I chalked this up to the example using a different source, which was more or less confirmed by a search for Chevrolet's published statistics.
